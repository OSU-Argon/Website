      ## About Us


      <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar geochronology
      has had a profound impact on the Earth system sciences since its
      introduction in 1965. Here in the Argon Geochronology Laboratory at Oregon
      State University (OSU) we have been employing this dating method ever
      since 1977 with a focus on volcanism in both the marine and terrestrial
      environment to improve the geochronology of the ocean crust, ocean island
      volcanism, large igneous provinces, lunar and planetary rocks,
      hydrothermal minerals and clays, and so on â€¦

      ## Staff


      This NSF-sponsored facility is directed by Profs.
      [Koppers](http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/profile/koppers/) and open to
      visiting scientists and students from across and outside the USA. These
      principal investigators have built up strong research programs with an
      emphasis on the geochronology of ocean basin volcanism, including the
      dating of the ocean floor, seamounts, volcanic islands and large igneous
      provinces.
