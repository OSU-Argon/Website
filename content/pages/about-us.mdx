      ## About Us


      &#x20;<Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar
      geochronology has had a profound impact on the Earth system sciences since
      its introduction in 1965. Here in the Argon Geochronology Laboratory at
      Oregon State University (OSU) we have been employing this dating method
      ever since 1977 with a focus on volcanism in both the marine and
      terrestrial environment to improve the geochronology of the ocean crust,
      ocean island volcanism, large igneous provinces, lunar and planetary
      rocks, hydrothermal minerals and clays, and so on …

      ## Lab History


      Research employing K/Ar and later <Superscript value="40"
      />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar radiometric methods has a long history
      at the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS). In 1969
      the first Reynolds-design mass spectrometer was installed by Prof. David
      Tilles to undertake age determinations on lunar samples returned by the
      Apollo missions. Following his untimely death in 1970, Prof. Jack Dymond
      arrived at OSU to establish K/Ar dating in our Argon Geochronology
      Laboratory as well as noble gas geochemistry on terrestrial rocks.


      In 1977 Prof. Robert Duncan joined the CEOAS faculty and took over the
      role of principal investigator for the geochronology facility, while
      focusing efforts toward <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript
      value="39" />Ar dating of crustal rocks in the ocean basins. In 1980
      another mass spectrometer (AEI MS-10) was added with funding from NSF and
      research areas expanded into dating of terrigenous sediments, vein-filling
      minerals (celadonite, adularia) and ocean floor basalts. In 1991 NSF
      provided funds for an MAP 215-50 Mass Spectrometer. Today, this instrument
      is in heavy use for age determinations by <Superscript value="40"
      />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar methods, predominantly detailed
      incremental heating experiments using a Heine resistance furnace and a
      Merchantek MIR10-TP CO2 laser.


      At the beginning of 2007, Prof. Anthony Koppers joined the CEOAS faculty
      and together with Duncan now co-directs the <Superscript value="40"
      />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar facility. Following his arrival, our
      laboratory spaces have been upgraded and made ready for a new
      multi-collector ARGUS VI Mass Spectrometer funded by the National Science
      Foundation and installed in our laboratory in March 2012.


      In the summer of 2014 the MAP 215-50 Mass Spectrometer was dismantled in
      order to be replaced by a second ARGUS VI Mass Spectrometer funded by the
      Vetlesen Foundation, CEOAS and the Research Office of OSU. This second
      setup is expected to be fully operational in April 2015.
