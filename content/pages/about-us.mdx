      ## About Us


      &#x20;<Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar
      geochronology has had a profound impact on the Earth system sciences since
      its introduction in 1965. Here in the Argon Geochronology Laboratory at
      Oregon State University (OSU) we have been employing this dating method
      ever since 1977 with a focus on volcanism in both the marine and
      terrestrial environment to improve the geochronology of the ocean crust,
      ocean island volcanism, large igneous provinces, lunar and planetary
      rocks, hydrothermal minerals and clays, and so on …

      ## Staff


      This NSF-sponsored facility is directed by Profs.
      [Koppers](http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/profile/koppers/ "") and open to
      visiting scientists and students from across and outside the USA. These
      principal investigators have built up strong research programs with an
      emphasis on the geochronology of ocean basin volcanism, including the
      dating of the ocean floor, seamounts, volcanic islands and large igneous
      provinces.
