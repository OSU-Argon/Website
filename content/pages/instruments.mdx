      ## Instruments


      Our laboratory is equipped with two noble gas mass spectrometers for
      carrying out 40Ar/39Ar age determinations. We have two brand-new [Thermo
      Scientific ARGUS VI](/instruments/#ARGUS-VI) multi-collector (installed in
      2012 and 2015) with five fixed Faraday detectors and one ion-counting CuBe
      electron multiplier.

      ### ARGUS VI


      Our two instruments are [Thermo Scientific Model ARGUS
      VI](/instruments/#ARGUS-VI) multi-collector mass spectrometers with five
      fixed Faraday detectors (including amplifier circuits with 1013 Ohm
      resistors) and one ion-counting CuBe electron multiplier mounted next to
      the low mass 36 Faraday detector. This system is equipped with an 25 W
      Synrad CO2 laser with industrial scan head for carrying out gas
      extractions. The ARGUS VI can be operated in three different modes:


      * **Multi-collector Mode** to simultaneously collect all masses m/e = 36,
      37, 38, 39 and 40 on the 1012 Ohm Faraday collector array for samples
      providing sufficient amounts of gas for analyses

      * **Peak-switching Ion-counting Mode** using the CuBe electron multiplier
      for high-precision analyses on (very) small gas fractions

      * **Combination Mode** whereby all masses will be measured simultaneously
      in a multi-collector mode, but with mass m/e = 36 aimed on the CuBe
      electron multiplier and masses m/e = 37, 38, 39 and 40 on the adjacent
      Faraday cups


      The latter configuration provides the advantages of running in a full
      multi-collector mode while measuring the lowest peak (on mass 36) on the
      highly sensitive electron multiplier. Even though the ARGUS VI has a
      fixed-position collector array, an electronic steering plate placed before
      every collector allows for nudging over the beams to fall exactly in the
      middle of all five collectors. In addition, in both multi-collector
      Faraday modes we would have the option to use 1011 Ohm resistors with a
      very low baseline noise of ~2×10-17 A or higher 1013 Ohm resistors that
      are more sensitive, when these come on the market.


      The ARGUS VI is connected to an all-metal extraction system for 40Ar/39Ar
      age determinations. It has an overall lower volume (~500 cc) than our MAP
      215-50 system but we use a similar set of getters for cleaning up the
      reactive gasses with one SAES ST-101 Zr-Al getter (450 °C) and two SAES
      ST-172 Zr-V-Fe getters (21 °C and 250 °C). Beside its lower volume, the
      design of the CO2 laser system is also different by using an industrial
      Synrad XY scan head for steering the laser beam during sample heating.
      This allows us to carry out the sample heating by setting up a beam raster
      pattern while keeping the sample housing stationary. Using this novel
      technique we can produce a laser beam that can move continuously up and
      down at speeds up to 300 in/s and that results in an even heating of the
      entire sample being analyzed, a prerequisite for carrying out first-rate
      incremental heating experiments. This laser system will be equipped with
      an air-cooled Synrad 25W CO2 laser that has a maximum laser power
      sufficient for the fusion of single crystals and flux monitors.


      The custom-made extraction line will feature two laser chambers, an open
      port for later attachment of a low-volume resistance furnace with an
      automated sample carousel, three SAES getters, and two air pipette systems
      (one for air and one for an 38Ar spiked air standard). All resulting ages
      are calculated using the [ArArCALC v2.5.2](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)
      software package (Koppers, 2002).

      ### MAP 215-50 (1991-2014)


      Our previous instrument was a [Mass Analyser Products (MAP) Model
      215-50](/instruments/#MAP215-50) mass spectrometer that is a
      single-collector 90° sector instrument with a Nier-type source. On the
      collector end it has a Johnston MM1-1SG electron multiplier and an
      electrostatic analyzer with adjustable collector slit for high resolution
      of masses in the Argon isotope range. This system is equipped with a Heine
      low-blank, double-vacuum resistance furnace and a first-generation
      Merchantek MIR10-TP integrated CO2 laser gas extraction system with an
      infrared pyrometer.


      The MAP 215-50 is connected to an all-metal extraction system for
      40Ar/39Ar age determinations. This is an ultra-clean, low volume (~1000
      cc) gas cleanup line that uses one SAES ST-101 Zr-Al getter (450 °C) and
      two SAES ST-172 Zr-V-Fe getters (21 °C and 250 °C) to effectively remove
      reactive and interfering gasses in a two-stage clean up.


      For gas extractions using the resistance furnace, irradiated samples,
      either whole rock mini-cores or Cu-wrapped mineral separates, are loaded
      into a sample manifold that feeds into a Ta/Nb-crucible with a Mo-liner.
      Temperatures are precisely controlled at the bottom of the crucible with a
      programmable power supply thermocouple system. For experiments using the
      laser system, irradiated samples, either crushed whole-rock, groundmass,
      mineral separates, single-grain or in-situ mineral veins are loaded into a
      Cu-planchette designed with a variety of pits/pans that hold \< 1 to 50 mg
      of material, which is then pumped to an ultra-high vacuum within a sample
      chamber fitted with a ZnS window that is transparent to the CO2 laser
      wavelength. Temperatures are monitored with an infrared pyrometer and
      controlled by varying the laser power percentage through a computer.


      Ion beam currents are measured with the electron multiplier at m/e = 36,
      37, 38, 39 and 40 and intervening (half-mass offset) baselines.
      Measurement times, peak/baseline voltages, data acquisition and storage
      are computer controlled using an 8.5 digit integrating multimeter. Peak
      heights typically decay during an analysis and the regressed peak heights
      vs. time generally follow first-order exponential fits. Mass
      discrimination is monitored using an air standard that can be aliquoted
      using an 0.1 cc air-pipette system (at ~3.5×10-12 moles of 40Ar per
      volume). All resulting ages are calculated using the [ArArCALC
      v2.4](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/) software package (Koppers, 2002).
