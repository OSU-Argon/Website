      Research employing K/Ar and later <Superscript value="40"
      />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar radiometric methods has a long history
      at the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS). In 1969
      the first Reynolds-design mass spectrometer was installed by Prof. David
      Tilles to undertake age determinations on lunar samples returned by the
      Apollo missions. Following his untimely death in 1970, Prof. Jack Dymond
      arrived at OSU to establish K/Ar dating in our Argon Geochronology
      Laboratory as well as noble gas geochemistry on terrestrial rocks.


      In 1977 Prof. Robert Duncan joined the CEOAS faculty and took over the
      role of principal investigator for the geochronology facility, while
      focusing efforts toward <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript
      value="39" />Ar dating of crustal rocks in the ocean basins. In 1980
      another mass spectrometer (AEI MS-10) was added with funding from NSF and
      research areas expanded into dating of terrigenous sediments, vein-filling
      minerals (celadonite, adularia) and ocean floor basalts. In 1991 NSF
      provided funds for an MAP 215-50 Mass Spectrometer. Today, this instrument
      is in heavy use for age determinations by <Superscript value="40"
      />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar methods, predominantly detailed
      incremental heating experiments using a Heine resistance furnace and a
      Merchantek MIR10-TP CO2 laser.

      At the beginning of 2007, Prof. Anthony Koppers joined the CEOAS faculty
      and together with Duncan now co-directs the <Superscript value="40"
      />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar facility. Following his arrival, our
      laboratory spaces have been upgraded and made ready for a new
      multi-collector ARGUS VI Mass Spectrometer funded by the National Science
      Foundation and installed in our laboratory in March 2012.


      In the summer of 2014 the MAP 215-50 Mass Spectrometer was dismantled in
      order to be replaced by a second ARGUS VI Mass Spectrometer funded by the
      Vetlesen Foundation, CEOAS and the Research Office of OSU.

      ### MAP 215-50 (1991-2014)


      Our previous instrument was a [Mass Analyser Products (MAP) Model
      215-50](/instruments/#MAP215-50) mass spectrometer that is a
      single-collector 90° sector instrument with a Nier-type source. On the
      collector end it has a Johnston MM1-1SG electron multiplier and an
      electrostatic analyzer with adjustable collector slit for high resolution
      of masses in the Argon isotope range. This system is equipped with a Heine
      low-blank, double-vacuum resistance furnace and a first-generation
      Merchantek MIR10-TP integrated CO2 laser gas extraction system with an
      infrared pyrometer.


      The MAP 215-50 is connected to an all-metal extraction system for
      <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar age
      determinations. This is an ultra-clean, low volume (~1000 cc) gas cleanup
      line that uses one SAES ST-101 Zr-Al getter (450 °C) and two SAES ST-172
      Zr-V-Fe getters (21 °C and 250 °C) to effectively remove reactive and
      interfering gasses in a two-stage clean up.

      For gas extractions using the resistance furnace, irradiated samples,
      either whole rock mini-cores or Cu-wrapped mineral separates, are loaded
      into a sample manifold that feeds into a Ta/Nb-crucible with a Mo-liner.
      Temperatures are precisely controlled at the bottom of the crucible with a
      programmable power supply thermocouple system. For experiments using the
      laser system, irradiated samples, either crushed whole-rock, groundmass,
      mineral separates, single-grain or in-situ mineral veins are loaded into a
      Cu-planchette designed with a variety of pits/pans that hold \< 1 to 50 mg
      of material, which is then pumped to an ultra-high vacuum within a sample
      chamber fitted with a ZnS window that is transparent to the CO2 laser
      wavelength. Temperatures are monitored with an infrared pyrometer and
      controlled by varying the laser power percentage through a computer.


      Ion beam currents are measured with the electron multiplier at m/e = 36,
      37, 38, 39 and 40 and intervening (half-mass offset) baselines.
      Measurement times, peak/baseline voltages, data acquisition and storage
      are computer controlled using an 8.5 digit integrating multimeter. Peak
      heights typically decay during an analysis and the regressed peak heights
      vs. time generally follow first-order exponential fits. Mass
      discrimination is monitored using an air standard that can be aliquoted
      using an 0.1 cc air-pipette system (at ~3.5×10-12 moles of 40Ar per
      volume). All resulting ages are calculated using the [ArArCALC
      v2.4](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/) software package (Koppers, 2002).
