      # <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar Age
      Determinations Using ARGUS-VI


      The [OSU Argon Geochronology Lab](http://osu-argon.org) carries out
      <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar analyses for
      researchers, students and outside clients against a service fee as defined
      in the OSU Fee Book. If you are interested in getting your samples age
      dated, please [Contact Us](/contact-us) to discuss your project and
      geochronology goals and to receive instructions for completing the
      analytical service request. We will send you a sample form in the
      Microsoft Excel format, which is required as a first step in defining your
      geochronology project. Geological materials that we can date, pricing and
      typical turnaround times for the different level of services provided are
      indicated below.

      ## <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar  Age
      Determination via Bulk Incremental Heating


      Incremental heating experiments are carried out with a raster scanning 30W
      Synrad CO2 laser and the argon gas samples extracted are cleaned on a
      customized Thermo Scientific NG Prep System and analyzed using a Thermo
      Scientific ARGUS VI Multi-collector Mass Spectrometer. Included in this
      service are up to 30 heating steps, up to 15 blanks, sample irradiation,
      flux monitor measurements, air short calibrations and other age standard
      measurements. A minimal data report along with a description of our
      mineral separation protocol, acid leaching cleaning procedures, and mass
      spectrometry analyses will be included when the data is delivered via
      email.

      ### OSU TRIGA Irradiations


      Samples are irradiated at the [OSU Radiation
      Center](http://radiationcenter.oregonstate.edu/) in the TRIGA experimental
      reactor, typically at 1 MW power for periods appropriate for the age and
      composition of sample unknowns. The neutron flux is monitored with a
      variety of standard samples (Mmhb-1 hornblende, FCT-3 biotite, TCR
      sanidine). There is also a Cd-shielded irradiation location which is
      designed to block slow (thermal) neutrons in preference to fast neutrons.
      Irradiated materials are disposed through the [OSU Radiation Safety
      Office](http://oregonstate.edu/ehs/rso). All workers in our laboratory are
      trained in the safe handling of radioactive materials.
