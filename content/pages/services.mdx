  - body: "## Services\n\nThe [OSU Argon Geochronology Lab](http://geochronology.coas.oregonstate.edu \"\") carries out 40Ar/39Ar analyses services for outside researchers. If you are interested in getting your samples age dated, then follow the instructions on this page. If you have more questions, please [Contact Us](/about-us/#contact-us \"\") before you start your sample preparation.\n\n### Sample Preparation and Amounts\n\nWe employ a variety of methods to prepare samples for age determinations. The applied methods and amounts of material needed depend on rock type, age, alteration state, the project goals, and on which mass spectrometer the analyses will be carried out.\n\n[Read More about our Sample Preparation Protocols](/sample-preparation-and-amounts/ \"\")\n\nSend your samples to our [Shipment Address](/about-us/#shipment-address \"\") when ready.\n\n### OSU TRIGA Irradiations\n\nSamples are irradiated at the [OSU Radiation Center](http://radiationcenter.oregonstate.edu/ \"\") in the TRIGA experimental reactor, typically at 1 MW power for periods appropriate for the age and composition of sample unknowns. The neutron flux is monitored with a variety of standard samples (Mmhb-1 hornblende, FCT-3 biotite, TCR sanidine). There is also a Cd-shielded irradiation location which is designed to block slow (thermal) neutrons in preference to fast neutrons. Irradiated materials are disposed through the [OSU Radiation Safety Office](http://oregonstate.edu/ehs/rso \"\"). All workers in our laboratory are trained in the safe handling of radioactive materials.\n\n### Analysis Fee\n\nThe standard analysis fee per sample for an incremental heating experiment with up to **30** steps on the [ARGUS VI](/instruments/#ARGUS-VI \"\") multi-collector is [$1,300](/services/ \"\") and includes standard procedure sample preparation, irradiation, disposal of irradiated material and data reduction.\n\nSamples are typically analyzed in the order received.\n\nFor other than the standard fee schedule (e.g. incremental heating experiments with more incremental heating steps, single crystal total fusion experiments, expedited processing, application of more elaborate sample preparation and/or acid-leaching procedures) or if you would like to visit our facility and take part in the data analyses, please [Contact Us](/about-us/#contact-us \"\").\n\n| Service   | Amount                          | Turnaround Time | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n| --------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n| Standard  | \_$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1,300.00 | \_8-12 months    | 30 incremental heating steps or single crystal total fusions using the Thermo Scientific Model ARGUS VI multi-collector\\<br>mass spectrometer.
