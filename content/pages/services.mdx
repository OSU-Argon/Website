      ### OSU TRIGA Irradiations


      Samples are irradiated at the [OSU Radiation
      Center](http://radiationcenter.oregonstate.edu/) in the TRIGA experimental
      reactor, typically at 1 MW power for periods appropriate for the age and
      composition of sample unknowns. The neutron flux is monitored with a
      variety of standard samples (Mmhb-1 hornblende, FCT-3 biotite, TCR
      sanidine). There is also a Cd-shielded irradiation location which is
      designed to block slow (thermal) neutrons in preference to fast neutrons.
      Irradiated materials are disposed through the [OSU Radiation Safety
      Office](http://oregonstate.edu/ehs/rso). All workers in our laboratory are
      trained in the safe handling of radioactive materials.
