      # <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar Age
      Determinations Using ARGUS-VI


      The [OSU Argon Geochronology Lab](http://osu-argon.org) carries out
      <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar analyses for
      researchers, post-docs, students and outside clients against a service fee
      as defined in the OSU Fee Book. If you are interested in getting your
      samples age dated in our laboratory, download the **Sample Request
      Spreadsheet** below, fill it out completely in Microsoft Excel, and email
      the forms to
      [geochronology@oregonstate.edu](mailto\:geochronology@oregonstate.edu).
      You can also contact us at
      [geochronology@oregonstate.edu](mailto\:geochronology@oregonstate.edu) to
      discuss your project and geochronology goals and to receive further
      instructions for completing the analytical service request.


      **Geological Materials** that we can date, pricing and typical turnaround
      times for the different level of services provided are indicated below.
      All experiments are carried out using **30W Synrad CO2 Lasers** in a
      raster-scanning mode and the argon gas samples extracted are cleaned using
      customized **Thermo Scientific NG Prep Systems** and analyzed using one of
      two **Thermo Scientific ARGUS VI Multi-Collector Mass Spectrometers**.

      ## Collaborative Rates


      We offer several collaborative rates for researchers, post-docs and
      students that would like to collaborate with the** [OSU Argon
      Geochronology Lab](\\)** on scientific publications, students that visit
      Oregon State University and prepare their own samples, or for clients that
      provide us with clean pre-prepared samples.

      ### OSU TRIGA Irradiations


      Samples are irradiated at the [OSU Radiation
      Center](http://radiationcenter.oregonstate.edu/) in the TRIGA experimental
      reactor, typically at 1 MW power for periods appropriate for the age and
      composition of sample unknowns. The neutron flux is monitored with a
      variety of standard samples (Mmhb-1 hornblende, FCT-3 biotite, TCR
      sanidine). There is also a Cd-shielded irradiation location which is
      designed to block slow (thermal) neutrons in preference to fast neutrons.
      Irradiated materials are disposed through the [OSU Radiation Safety
      Office](http://oregonstate.edu/ehs/rso). All workers in our laboratory are
      trained in the safe handling of radioactive materials.
