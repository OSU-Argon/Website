      ## Services


      The [OSU Argon Geochronology
      Lab](http://geochronology.coas.oregonstate.edu) carries out 40Ar/39Ar
      analyses services for outside researchers. If you are interested in
      getting your samples age dated, then follow the instructions on this page.
      If you have more questions, please [Contact Us](/about-us/#contact-us)
      before you start your sample preparation.


      ### Sample Preparation and Amounts


      We employ a variety of methods to prepare samples for age determinations.
      The applied methods and amounts of material needed depend on rock type,
      age, alteration state, the project goals, and on which mass spectrometer
      the analyses will be carried out.

      Protocols](/sample-preparation-and-amounts/)


      Send your samples to our [Shipment Address](/about-us/#shipment-address)
      when ready.

      ### OSU TRIGA Irradiations


      Samples are irradiated at the [OSU Radiation
      Center](http://radiationcenter.oregonstate.edu/) in the TRIGA experimental
      reactor, typically at 1 MW power for periods appropriate for the age and
      composition of sample unknowns. The neutron flux is monitored with a
      variety of standard samples (Mmhb-1 hornblende, FCT-3 biotite, TCR
      sanidine). There is also a Cd-shielded irradiation location which is
      designed to block slow (thermal) neutrons in preference to fast neutrons.
      Irradiated materials are disposed through the [OSU Radiation Safety
      Office](http://oregonstate.edu/ehs/rso). All workers in our laboratory are
      trained in the safe handling of radioactive materials.
