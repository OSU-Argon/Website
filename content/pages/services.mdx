      ## Services


      The [OSU Argon Geochronology
      Lab](http://geochronology.coas.oregonstate.edu) carries out 40Ar/39Ar
      analyses services for outside researchers. If you are interested in

      If you have more questions, please [Contact Us](/about-us/#contact-us)
      before you start your sample preparation.


      ### Sample Preparation and Amounts


      We employ a variety of methods to prepare samples for age determinations.
      The applied methods and amounts of material needed depend on rock type,
      age, alteration state, the project goals, and on which mass spectrometer
      the analyses will be carried out.
