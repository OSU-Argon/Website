        title: Introduction
        text: >
          In our **[OSU Argon Geochronology Lab](/)** we employ the <Superscript
          value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar geochronology method to
          determine how hotspots evolve and interact with the lithosphere, in
          quantifying rates at which large igneous provinces are constructed, in
          deciphering the early history of the Earth and Moon, in tracking
          transport pathways of terrigenous sediments from rivers to deep-sea
          sediments, and more.

          Our lab is equipped with two noble gas mass spectrometers for carrying
          out <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar age
          determinations. We carry out analyses on two Thermo Scientific ARGUS
          VI multi-collector instruments outfitted with five fixed Faraday
          detectors using 10<Superscript value="12" /> Ω resistors for mass 40
          and 10<Superscript value="13" /> Ω resistors for masses 39, 38 and 37,
          and one ion-counting CuBe electron multiplier for mass 36.

          Since 1977 investigators, students and post-docs in our laboratory
          have produced <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39"
          />Ar age data that appeared in more than 200 peer-reviewed
          publications and in 35 Senior, MSc and PhD theses. This long list of
          papers could not have been possible without the more than 100 visitors
          over the last decades and our numerous national and international
          collaborators.
